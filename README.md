# Cracker-
linear equations solver
So this algorithm processes any equation of one variable in form of a string and computes the value. Probably cool. You decide. It's based on an algorithm I developed long ago in java to process any mathematical expression accepted by some of the most advanced calculators.will be putting that up soon. But cracker's ultimate function is named "crack1" and it requires 2 parameters both strings. The first is a String of a linear equation of one variable with an "=" sign and then a String of the independent variable (character).certain alphabets can't be used as variables such as 'a, x' and a few others since the whole algorithm is based on string processing. Both classes must however be used in the same package:Mycalc and cracker.  Cracker's functions are however all static for testing purposes. A sample of the test is found in cracker's main function. 1
